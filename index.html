<p>
PWE is an online game publisher. I was hired to deploy and operate the server
infrastructure for an upcoming release, then became the SME and primary liaison
between PWE Network Operations and the development studio. My role at PWE grew
into other projects until I was on a small team responsible for most of the 
infrastructure in the company. 
</p>
<p>
Manage DNS, the CDN, and load balancers. Coordinate with game studios and 
internal departments to support projects with new technologies and hardware.
Maintain legacy applications in a sparsely documented production environment.
Triage, troubleshoot, and resolve issues across the full stack and document what we
learn.
</p>
<p>
Moved stateful servers from a cloud-native Kubernetes application and deployed
them to datacenter hardware. The datacenter hardware cost approximately 25% of 
the cloud hardware. The services that remained on the cloud were moved to 
pre-emptible instances resulting in a 70% reduction in cloud compute costs.

portion of Torchlight 2.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Hired to deploy and support the then upcoming title Gigantic by the Seattle
based studio Motiga. The backend of Gigantic was a mix of Windows and
Linux servers running a microservice architecture across bare metal,
virtualized, and cloud hardware. Created a process that allowed for 
fast provisioning of cloud servers in case we ran out of datacenter capacity
at launch. After population was lower than anticipated, I shrank the footprint
of the game from ~150 servers to 15 to reduce operating cost.
</p>
<p>
Created procedure to automate repurposing Dell and Huawei servers for
new games with Ansible, PXE, and Kickstart. 
</p>
<p>
Migrated hosts to VMs on newer hardware including in-house built services 
used by other departments and studios including CMS used by Customer Service,
application monitoring, and infrastructure to send in-game broadcasts.
